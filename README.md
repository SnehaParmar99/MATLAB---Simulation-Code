# MATLAB---Simulation-Code
Satellite-positioning Simulation Code

Instructions:

1. Download MATLAB 7
2. Load the programs.
3. Run the file be3.m
4. The GUI model will open, input angle values and axis number(E.g. angle=45 axis=1 will rotate about yaw axis)
5. Click simulate button
6. Observe the simulation and the graph which follows
7. For remaining plots, uncomment the respective lines in the code fun_be.m
8. For programming on DSP(digital signal processor), a basic C++ code is Fin.cpp in the folder 'Software_codes'
9. The cpp file, after adding dsp header files can be used to check real-time output.
